```{r}
activity_new = aggregate(steps~date, data = activity, sum)

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(activity_new, aes(x=date, y = steps)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
```

Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
mean(activity_new$steps)
median(activity_new$steps)

```
